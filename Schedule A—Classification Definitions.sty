A.3                Classification principles

A.3.1            General

In determining the appropriate classification of a position or job to be filled by an employee, an employer will pay full regard to:

(a)          the nature and skill requirements of the position to be filled;

(b)          the skill level and certification of the employee;

(c)           the experience and qualifications of the employee in:

(i)            relevant indicative tasks nominated in clauses A.2.1(d), A.2.2(c), A.2.3(c), A.2.4(c), A.2.5(c), A.2.6(c), A.2.7(c) and A.2.8(c); and/or

(ii)          competency standards against which an employee is accredited;

(d)          any agreed national procedures established for testing the validity of an employee’s claim for reclassification.

A.3.2            Classification/reclassification in the engineering stream

(a)          Where an employee has the relevant qualification recognised as a minimum training requirement for the level to which the employee seeks to be reclassified and they are exercising or are required to exercise the skills and knowledge gained for the qualification necessary for that level of work, the employee will be classified appropriately.

(b)          In the event that there is a claim for reclassification by an existing employee to a higher level under the new structure on the grounds that the employee possesses equivalent skill and knowledge gained through on-the-job experience, the following principles apply:

(i)            the dispute resolution provisions in 39—Dispute resolution will be followed;

(ii)          competency standards will be established through the appropriate Industry Training Boards, co-ordinated by MSA and for the lift industry the Ee-Oz. Such standards will be consistent with the requirements of the National Training Framework Committee for relevant levels in the new classification structure before claims for reclassification at that level are processed;

(iii)        procedures will be established for testing the validity of an employee’s claim for reclassification.

(c)           Where skill standards have not been finalised in respect of any class of work and they are necessary for determining an employee’s classification, employees performing such work will not be reclassified until such standards are available except as provided for in clauses A.3.2(a) and A.3.2(d) of this Schedule.

(d)          Where the situation described in clause A.3.2(c) applies, but not in any other circumstances, an employee may be reclassified on the basis that the employee meets the requirements of the old classification definitions in the National Metal and Engineering On-site Construction Industry Award 2002.

A.4                Skill based career structure

A.4.1            The classification structure is designed to facilitate the improvement of the level of skills of the workforce and to provide a career path for all employees.

A.4.2            Each classification level builds upon the previous level so that the value of an employee to the industry and their employer increases as the employee progresses through the structure. Skills are built up in a sequential manner through job learnt skills and structured training.

A.4.3            Under the new classification structure, an employee’s building and construction industry skills are to be formally recognised, industry wide, at all levels from new entrant to CW/ECW 8–ECW 9. Employees will move up the classification structure as they acquire additional accredited skills. Payment will be on the basis of the level of skills required to perform the work of a particular position or job offered by an employer.

A.5                Training

In order to facilitate the operation of the classification structure an employer must, in co-operation with the consultative committee develop a training programme consistent with:

(a)          the size, structure and scope of the activities of the employer;

(b)          the need to develop vocational skills relevant to the enterprise and the building and construction industry generally through courses conducted by accredited educational institutions and providers.

(c)           Where, as a result of consultation in accordance with clause A.5 it is agreed that additional training should be undertaken by the employee, that training may be taken either on or off the job. Provided that if the training is undertaken during normal working hours the employee concerned will not suffer any loss of pay. The employer must not unreasonably withhold such paid training leave.

(d)          Any costs associated with standard fees for prescribed course and prescribed textbooks (excluding those textbooks which are contained in the employers technical library) incurred in connection with the undertaking of training pursuant to clause A.5(c) will be reimbursed by the employer upon the production of evidence of such expenditure. Provided that reimbursement will be subject to the presentation of reports of satisfactory progress.

(e)          Travel costs incurred by an employee undertaking training in accordance with clause A.5 which exceed those normally incurred travelling to and from work will be reimbursed by the employer.

A.6                Definitions of classifications in Schedule A

The broadbanded award classifications referred to in clause A.2 of this Schedule will have the meaning ascribed to them by an award made under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) or a notional agreement preserving a State award that would have applied to an employee immediately prior to 1 January 2010; or a Division 2B State award that would have applied to the employee immediately prior to 1 January 2011.
