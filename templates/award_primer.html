            <div class="section-content">
                <p>The award sets the minimum amount you need to pay your employees. There are different pay levels depending on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The job they do</li>
                    <li>Their skills and qualifications</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For example, a general labourer might have a different minimum wage than a qualified carpenter.</p>
                <p>There are also extra payments called allowances that might apply in certain situations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Leading hand allowance for employees in charge of a team</li>
                    <li>Some jobs in the residential building sector might have rates that already include industry or tool allowances</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Overtime on weekdays: 1.5x normal rate for first couple of hours, then 2x rate after that</li>
                    <li>Sundays and public holidays: Usually have even higher penalty rates</li>

                <div class="coverage-section">
                    <h3>General Building and Construction</h3>
                    <p>This is your everyday construction work, like building houses, apartments, offices, and shops. It also covers renovations, repairs, demolitions, and even landscaping work done as part of a building project.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>Example:</strong> A company that builds new homes or renovates existing ones, and their employees like carpenters, bricklayers, and general labourers, would likely be covered.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="coverage-section">
                    <h3>Civil Construction</h3>
                    <p>This involves bigger projects like roads, bridges, tunnels, railways, water and sewerage systems, and even sports stadiums.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>Example:</strong> A company constructing a new highway or a team working on building a bridge would fall under this category.

                <div class="coverage-section">
                    <h3>Metal and Engineering Construction</h3>
                    <p>This covers large industrial and commercial projects, including factories, power plants, and installing things like lifts and escalators.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>Example:</strong> A business that fabricates and installs steel structures for a warehouse, and their boilermakers and welders, would likely be covered.

                </div>

                <div class="coverage-section">
                    <h3>Specific Worker Types</h3>
                    <p>Specifically, if you employ people who work on-site as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Labourers</li>

                        <li>Machine operators (like excavators and forklifts)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This award is likely relevant. Even if you use a labour hire company to get workers for your construction projects, those workers are also covered by this award.</p>
